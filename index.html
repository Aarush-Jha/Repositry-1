    <p id="hobbies">I like reading because it is fun imagining all the characters as it makes you feel like a part of the story. Watching TV is fun as it is fun watching people do cool tricks, make everyone laugh etc. And playing games is fun as it helps us to lift our mood when we are sad or to have fun when you are bored. It is fun trying beat your high score again and again, beat your friends and climb the leaderboard.
